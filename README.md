This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to a memory location that hasn't been allocated. This results in undefined behavior, typically a crash. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.cpp`, shows how to safely handle potential null pointers using checks before dereferencing.
